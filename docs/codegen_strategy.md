## Code Generation Approach

### Using OpenAPI for API Client Generation

Instead of manually implementing the YNAB API client, we'll leverage OpenAPI code generation to automatically create a fully-featured client library based on the official YNAB API specification. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Reduced Development Time**: Eliminates the need to write and maintain hundreds of lines of boilerplate API client code
2. **Accuracy**: Ensures our client implementation exactly matches YNAB's API specification
3. **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to update when YNAB updates their API
4. **Type Safety**: Provides strongly-typed models and methods that match YNAB's API exactly

### Tools for Code Generation

We'll use one of the following tools for API client generation:

1. **NSwag**

   - Native .NET tooling that integrates well with the .NET ecosystem
   - Can generate both client-side and server-side code
   - Supports various output formats including C#
   - Can be integrated into the build process

   Example command:

   ```powershell
   dotnet tool install -g NSwag.ConsoleCore
   nswag openapi2csclient /input:ynab_openapi.yaml /classname:YnabClient /namespace:YnabMcpServer.Generated.YnabApi /output:Generated/YnabApi/YnabClient.cs
   ```

2. **OpenAPI Generator**

   - More extensive language support
   - Often more configurable
   - Can generate more idiomatic C# code in some cases

   Example command:

   ```powershell
   dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.dotnet-openapi
   openapi-generator generate -i ynab_openapi.yaml -g csharp-netcore -o Generated/YnabApi --additional-properties=packageName=YnabMcpServer.Generated.YnabApi
   ```

We'll evaluate both approaches to determine which provides the most suitable generated code for our needs.

### Integration Strategy

1. **Generate Base Client**:

   - Download the YNAB OpenAPI spec from `https://api.ynab.com/papi/open_api_spec.yaml`
   - Generate the client code using the selected tool
   - Place generated code in the `Generated/YnabApi` directory

2. **Create Extension Layer**:

   - Implement extension methods to make the generated client more convenient to use
   - Add higher-level abstractions as needed in `Services/YnabApiClientExtensions.cs`
   - Handle authentication injection and other cross-cutting concerns

3. **Tool Implementation**:
   - Keep the MCP tools focused on transforming between MCP Tool requests/responses and YNAB API calls
   - Use the generated client through the extension layer
   - Implement any necessary business logic in the tools layer
