# For Server Developers

> Get started building your own server to use in Claude for Desktop and other clients.

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple MCP weather server and connect it to a host, Claude for Desktop. We'll start with a basic setup, and then progress to more complex use cases.

### What we'll be building

Many LLMs do not currently have the ability to fetch the forecast and severe weather alerts. Let's use MCP to solve that!

We'll build a server that exposes two tools: `get-alerts` and `get-forecast`. Then we'll connect the server to an MCP host (in this case, Claude for Desktop):

</Frame>

<Note>
  Servers can connect to any client. We've chosen Claude for Desktop here for simplicity, but we also have guides on [building your own client](/quickstart/client) as well as a [list of other clients here](/clients).
</Note>

<Accordion title="Why Claude for Desktop and not Claude.ai?">
  Because servers are locally run, MCP currently only supports desktop hosts. Remote hosts are in active development.
</Accordion>

### Core MCP Concepts

MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:

1. **Resources**: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents)
2. **Tools**: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
3. **Prompts**: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks

This tutorial will primarily focus on tools.

  <Tab title="C#">
    Let's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/tree/main/samples/QuickstartWeatherServer)

    ### Prerequisite knowledge

    This quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:

    * C#
    * LLMs like Claude
    * .NET 8 or higher

    ### System requirements

    * [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or higher installed.

    ### Set up your environment

    First, let's install `dotnet` if you haven't already. You can download `dotnet` from [official Microsoft .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/). Verify your `dotnet` installation:

    ```bash
    dotnet --version
    ```

    Now, let's create and set up your project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      # Create a new directory for our project
      mkdir weather
      cd weather
      # Initialize a new C# project
      dotnet new console
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      # Create a new directory for our project
      mkdir weather
      cd weather
      # Initialize a new C# project
      dotnet new console
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    After running `dotnet new console`, you will be presented with a new C# project.
    You can open the project in your favorite IDE, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).
    Alternatively, you can create a C# application using the [Visual Studio project wizard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-console?view=vs-2022).
    After creating the project, add NuGet package for the Model Context Protocol SDK and hosting:

    ```bash
    # Add the Model Context Protocol SDK NuGet package
    dotnet add package ModelContextProtocol --prerelease
    # Add the .NET Hosting NuGet package
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
    ```

    Now let’s dive into building your server.

    ## Building your server

    Open the `Program.cs` file in your project and replace its contents with the following code:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
    using ModelContextProtocol;
    using System.Net.Http.Headers;

    var builder = Host.CreateEmptyApplicationBuilder(settings: null);

    builder.Services.AddMcpServer()
        .WithStdioServerTransport()
        .WithToolsFromAssembly();

    builder.Services.AddSingleton(_ =>
    {
        var client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.weather.gov") };
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.UserAgent.Add(new ProductInfoHeaderValue("weather-tool", "1.0"));
        return client;
    });

    var app = builder.Build();

    await app.RunAsync();
    ```

    <Note>
      When creating the `ApplicationHostBuilder`, ensure you use `CreateEmptyApplicationBuilder` instead of `CreateDefaultBuilder`. This ensures that the server does not write any additional messages to the console. This is only neccessary for servers using STDIO transport.
    </Note>

    This code sets up a basic console application that uses the Model Context Protocol SDK to create an MCP server with standard I/O transport.

    ### Weather API helper functions

    Next, define a class with the tool execution handlers for querying and converting responses from the National Weather Service API:

    ```csharp
    using ModelContextProtocol.Server;
    using System.ComponentModel;
    using System.Net.Http.Json;
    using System.Text.Json;

    namespace QuickstartWeatherServer.Tools;

    [McpServerToolType]
    public static class WeatherTools
    {
        [McpServerTool, Description("Get weather alerts for a US state.")]
        public static async Task<string> GetAlerts(
            HttpClient client,
            [Description("The US state to get alerts for.")] string state)
        {
            var jsonElement = await client.GetFromJsonAsync<JsonElement>($"/alerts/active/area/{state}");
            var alerts = jsonElement.GetProperty("features").EnumerateArray();

            if (!alerts.Any())
            {
                return "No active alerts for this state.";
            }

            return string.Join("\n--\n", alerts.Select(alert =>
            {
                JsonElement properties = alert.GetProperty("properties");
                return $"""
                        Event: {properties.GetProperty("event").GetString()}
                        Area: {properties.GetProperty("areaDesc").GetString()}
                        Severity: {properties.GetProperty("severity").GetString()}
                        Description: {properties.GetProperty("description").GetString()}
                        Instruction: {properties.GetProperty("instruction").GetString()}
                        """;
            }));
        }

        [McpServerTool, Description("Get weather forecast for a location.")]
        public static async Task<string> GetForecast(
            HttpClient client,
            [Description("Latitude of the location.")] double latitude,
            [Description("Longitude of the location.")] double longitude)
        {
            var jsonElement = await client.GetFromJsonAsync<JsonElement>($"/points/{latitude},{longitude}");
            var periods = jsonElement.GetProperty("properties").GetProperty("periods").EnumerateArray();

            return string.Join("\n---\n", periods.Select(period => $"""
                    {period.GetProperty("name").GetString()}
                    Temperature: {period.GetProperty("temperature").GetInt32()}°F
                    Wind: {period.GetProperty("windSpeed").GetString()} {period.GetProperty("windDirection").GetString()}
                    Forecast: {period.GetProperty("detailedForecast").GetString()}
                    """));
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Running the server

    Finally, run the server using the following command:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    This will start the server and listen for incoming requests on standard input/output.

    ## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

    <Note>
      Claude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/quickstart/client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.
    </Note>

    First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version
    here.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**
    We'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.
    For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```bash
        code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```powershell
        code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    You'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key. The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.
    In this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```json
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "weather": {
                    "command": "dotnet",
                    "args": [
                        "run",
                        "--project",
                        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT",
                        "--no-build"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```json
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "weather": {
                    "command": "dotnet",
                    "args": [
                        "run",
                        "--project",
                        "C:\\ABSOLUTE\\PATH\\TO\\PROJECT",
                        "--no-build"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This tells Claude for Desktop:

    1. There's an MCP server named "weather"
    2. Launch it by running `dotnet run /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT`
       Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Test with commands

Let's make sure Claude for Desktop is picking up the two tools we've exposed in our `weather` server. You can do this by looking for the hammer <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/claude-desktop-mcp-hammer-icon.svg" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/visual-indicator-mcp-tools.png" />
</Frame>

After clicking on the hammer icon, you should see two tools listed:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/available-mcp-tools.png" />
</Frame>

If your server isn't being picked up by Claude for Desktop, proceed to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for debugging tips.

If the hammer icon has shown up, you can now test your server by running the following commands in Claude for Desktop:

- What's the weather in Sacramento?
- What are the active weather alerts in Texas?

</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/weather-alerts.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Since this is the US National Weather service, the queries will only work for US locations.
</Note>

## What's happening under the hood

When you ask a question:

1. The client sends your question to Claude
2. Claude analyzes the available tools and decides which one(s) to use
3. The client executes the chosen tool(s) through the MCP server
4. The results are sent back to Claude
5. Claude formulates a natural language response
6. The response is displayed to you!

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Claude for Desktop Integration Issues">
    **Getting logs from Claude for Desktop**

    Claude.app logging related to MCP is written to log files in `~/Library/Logs/Claude`:

    * `mcp.log` will contain general logging about MCP connections and connection failures.
    * Files named `mcp-server-SERVERNAME.log` will contain error (stderr) logging from the named server.

    You can run the following command to list recent logs and follow along with any new ones:

    ```bash
    # Check Claude's logs for errors
    tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
    ```

    **Server not showing up in Claude**

    1. Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` file syntax
    2. Make sure the path to your project is absolute and not relative
    3. Restart Claude for Desktop completely

    **Tool calls failing silently**

    If Claude attempts to use the tools but they fail:

    1. Check Claude's logs for errors
    2. Verify your server builds and runs without errors
    3. Try restarting Claude for Desktop

    **None of this is working. What do I do?**

    Please refer to our [debugging guide](/docs/tools/debugging) for better debugging tools and more detailed guidance.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Weather API Issues">
    **Error: Failed to retrieve grid point data**

    This usually means either:

    1. The coordinates are outside the US
    2. The NWS API is having issues
    3. You're being rate limited

    Fix:

    * Verify you're using US coordinates
    * Add a small delay between requests
    * Check the NWS API status page

    **Error: No active alerts for \[STATE]**

    This isn't an error - it just means there are no current weather alerts for that state. Try a different state or check during severe weather.
