# MCP and YNAB Integration Guide

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with external tools, services, and data sources. It creates a bridge between large language models (LLMs) and your personal data or applications, allowing for more personalized and useful AI interactions.

### How MCP Works

1. **Tool Registration**: Applications register tools (functions) that an AI can call
2. **User Permission**: Users grant permission for each tool use
3. **Contextual Knowledge**: The AI can access specific information through these tools
4. **Enhanced Capabilities**: The AI can perform actions it couldn't do on its own

MCP transforms AI assistants from general knowledge systems into personalized tools that understand your specific data and needs.

## Why Use MCP with YNAB?

YNAB (You Need A Budget) is a powerful personal finance tool that helps you track spending, set budgets, and achieve financial goals. By integrating YNAB with MCP, you unlock several benefits:

### 1. Personalized Financial Analysis

AI assistants can analyze your actual spending patterns, not just give general financial advice. They can identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities specific to your financial situation.

### 2. Natural Language Queries

Instead of navigating through YNAB's interface to find information, you can ask questions in plain English:

- "How much did I spend on restaurants last month?"
- "Am I on track with my savings goal?"
- "What's my average grocery spending this year compared to last year?"

### 3. Actionable Insights

Beyond just retrieving data, AI assistants can provide deeper analysis:

- Comparing spending across categories
- Identifying unusual transactions
- Suggesting budget adjustments
- Finding opportunities to save money

### 4. Privacy and Security

The YNAB MCP Server runs locally on your computer, meaning:

- Your financial data never leaves your device
- Your YNAB API token is stored securely
- No third parties gain access to your financial information
- You maintain complete control over what data is accessed and when

### 5. Enhanced Financial Planning

AI assistants can help with forward-looking scenarios:

- "If I reduce my dining out budget by $100, how would that impact my savings rate?"
- "What would happen if I increased my mortgage payment by $200 per month?"
- "How long will it take to save for a down payment at my current rate?"

## Real-World Use Cases

### Financial Review

Ask for a comprehensive monthly financial review that analyzes your income, spending patterns, savings rate, and progress toward financial goals.

### Budget Optimization

Have the AI identify areas where you're consistently over or under budget, and get recommendations for more realistic budget allocations.

### Spending Pattern Analysis

Identify spending trends and seasonal patterns that might not be obvious when looking at individual transactions.

### Financial Decision Support

When considering a major purchase or financial change, get an AI analysis of how it would impact your overall financial picture.

### Goal Tracking

Monitor progress toward savings goals with natural language updates and projections about when you'll reach your targets.
